## Content Description

Most of the documents you will see per folder are undergraduate texts, exams or codes. They are here to show my degree of mathematical understanding on advanced topics. Most of the pdf are in Spanish and the codes in English.  

- **DifferentialEquations**
  - Contais two pdf files: one is about [Green's Function](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GreensFunction.html) and the other is about 3-dimensional partial differential equations for the heat and wave equations.

- **FiniteElement**
  - Contains three python codes developed in Jupyter notebook showing the solution of the heat equation using the finite element method.The reforts are for a detailed description of the problem that the codes solve.

- **Tensors**
  - Contains only one pdf showing the mathematical procedure to prove properties of the [Riemann curvature tensor](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RiemannTensor.html).
